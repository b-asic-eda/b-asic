"""
B-ASIC module for research purposes.

This module contains functions that are used in different research
projects. They are typically not general enough to be part of the main
library, but are packaged here for convenience, reproducibility, and
that they may be useful for someone else as well.

The following module is currently available:

- :mod:`b_asic.research.interleaver`: generate matrix transposers and random interleavers.
